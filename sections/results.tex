%% Able to approximate the feasable control region by solving QP over large displacement space
Using our model-based control approach we have been able to control the position of the end effector of a linear/rotary 2DOF system with a root-mean-square error of less than --- m in linear displacement and --- $^\circ$ in rotation over a set of --- test points. This amounts to a control accuracy of within --- \% of the acheivable range of linear displacements, and --- \% of the achievable range of rotations.

%% Description of system
These preliminary results were achieved on a system comprised of a parallel configuration of three FREE actuators constrained to only linear and rotary displacements (Figure \ref{fig:modules}), as described in section \ref{sec:experiments}. All three actuators had a nominal radius and length of 5 mm and 100 mm, respectively. In order to ensure that both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations would be attainable, a counterclockwise twisting FREE with reinforcing fiber wrapped at a ---$^\circ$ angle with respect to horizontal, and a clockwise twisting FREE with the fiber wrapped at a ---$^\circ$ angle were both used, as well as another ----- twisting FREE with fiber wrapped at a ---$^\circ$ angle. Each of these FREEs is also of the contracting type, which is why the workspace lies entirely to the left of the origin in figure \ref{fig:results}.
