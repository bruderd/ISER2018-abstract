\subsection{Experiments Completed}
2DOF translation and rotation experiment. Iterate through a bunch of $\x^\tx{des}$ and compare the measured displacement to that predicted by the model, $\vec{e}_i = \x^\tx{des}_i - \x^\tx{meas}_i$. Then, do the same thing with a torsional load applied. Then do the same thing with unknown loads, but have a feedback loop with a gain on the fload term.
